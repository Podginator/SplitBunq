# Bunq Splitwise App

### What is it? 
Me and my partner have recently moved in together. One thing that we have decided is that we'd report joint expenses such as groceries on Splitwise.

I am incredibly forgetful.

So instead of trying to improve my ability to be a functioning adult, I decided instead to write a Bunq Integration so that I'd no longer have to report these things manually. It will take any expense from a debit card with the last 4 digits as indicated by me and import them directly to Splitwise. 

I have an apple pay card with bunq that I intend to use for all my joint expenses. 

As stated earlier I am very lazy so this uses an existing project as a baseline [twitter-stream]()
